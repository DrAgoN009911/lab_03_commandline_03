6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/03/mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz.   Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------
ent-v314-009:mtec1002 student$ curl -o mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/03/mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

If the directory does not exist:

a. go to your home folder
b. go back to step 6

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:

==========
9.  What directories are in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder?

Write the command(s) that you used to determine this - as well as its output - below:
----------
ls
(Nothing is in my mtec1002-lab-03 folder for the computer I use at home not the tech school.)
==========
10.  Now... go back home.  Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec1002-lab-03 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) (including going home) that you used to do this below:

cd .. MTEC1002
ent-v314-009:~ student$ 
cd .. student$
ent-v314-009:Users student$ 
==========
12.  Again, go back to your home directory.  Now... go to the science-fiction directory using an absolute path!  Verify that you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------
ent-v314-009:science-fiction student$ ~
-bash: /Users/student: is a directory
