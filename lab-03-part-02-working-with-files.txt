16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

cat: books/other/pg1232.txt: No such file or directory

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).

head books/other/pg1232.txt
 head: books/other/pg1232.txt: No such file or directory

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
less books/other/pg1232.txt
more books/other/pg1232.txt



==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
You would view less of a file for when there's a certain part needed to be viewed only.
You would view more of a ifle for when there's a lot to be seen to be viewed.
You would view all of the contents of a file when you use cat.
You would view a tail of a file when you want to view the bottom of a file.
You would view a head of a file when you want to view the top of a file.
